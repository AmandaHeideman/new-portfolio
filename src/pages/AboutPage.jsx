        <p>
          My name is Amanda Heideman, and I'm currently studying to become a
          full stack web developer. I first discovered programming when I was in
          high school, but after high school I decided to pursue my dream of
          becoming an archaeologist instead. Unfortunately that didn't work out
          for me, but I remembered how fun programming was, and so I chose this
          career path instead. And I'm really glad I did! What I really like
          about programming is all the problem solving. I love getting started
          on a new project, planning it out and trying to come up with the best
          solution. And nothing beats the feeling of finally solving a bug!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          When I'm not programming I like to knit, often while I watch a movie
          or tv show. I'm also a painter, mostly I use aquarelle or acrylics,
          but I also paint digitally sometimes.
